I'm an investigative reporter and multimedia director based in Madison, Wisconsin, at the [Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism](wisconsinwatch.org). I've worked there since 2010 and have helped the Center transform into the scrappy, award-winning organization it is today.

Now I'm looking for work in Sydney, Australia, where I plan to move later this year. [Contact me](kate.golden@gmail.com) if you have leads on that.

My work interests include:

* Data-driven journalism
* The environment (mostly water issues)
 - Climate change
 - Endocrine disruption
 - Nutrient pollution
 - Groundwater supply
 - Science and public policy
* Radio and podcasting
* Design
* Creative storytelling
* Public records laws

I'm on Twitter, here and there: [@wiswatchkate](twitter.com/wiswatchkate)

My personal interests include mushroom hunting, fishing, hunting and foraging (ancient history: [Madison Forager](http://madisonforager.wordpress.com)). I love the Western United States, particularly Alaska. I can stalk a deer and shoot it, navigate with a compass, swim two miles, and raise a sourdough starter from scratch. When I learn to throw and catch I will be apocalypse-ready.
