I'm an investigative reporter and the multimedia director at the [Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism](http://wisconsinwatch.org), based in Madison. I've worked there since 2010 and have helped transform the Center into the scrappy, award-winning organization it is today.

I am moving to Sydney, Australia, sometime around August 2015.

A smattering of my work interests:

* Data-driven journalism, including visualizations, especially maps
* The environment, especially water
  - Climate change
  - Endocrine disruption
  - Nutrient pollution
  - Groundwater quality and supply
  - Science and public policy
* Radio and podcasting
* Art and design in journalism
* Creative storytelling
* Public records

My personal interests include hunting for mushrooms or animals, fishing, foraging and fermentation (ancient history: <a href="http://madisonforager.wordpress.com">Madison Forager</a>). I love the Western United States, particularly Alaska. I can stalk a deer and shoot it, navigate with a compass, swim two miles, and raise a sourdough starter from scratch. So I am mostly apocalypse-ready.
