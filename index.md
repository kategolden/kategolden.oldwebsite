I'm a journalist in Sydney, Australia.

At the [The Walkley Foundation](http://walkleys.com),  I work on the Walkley Magazine, comms, and encouraging innovation and data journalism in Australia. Recently I ran [this hackathon](http://walkleys.com/editorslab). I run an event series on future-of-journalism topics called [Future Friday](http://www.walkleys.com/future-fridays/) and I'm always looking for suggestions.

Until last year I was an investigative reporter and the multimedia director at the [Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism](http://wisconsinwatch.org), based in Madison. I helped transform it into the scrappy, award-winning organization it is today.

A smattering of my work interests:

* Data-driven journalism, including visualizations, especially maps; and how to get other people into it
* The environment, especially water
  - Climate change
  - Endocrine disruption
  - Nutrient pollution
  - Groundwater quality and supply
  - Science and public policy
* Radio and podcasting
* Art and design in journalism
* Creative storytelling
* Public records

My personal interests include sailing, swimming, surfing badly, hunting for mushrooms or animals, fishing, foraging and fermentation (ancient history: <a href="http://madisonforager.wordpress.com">Madison Forager</a>). I love the Western United States, particularly Alaska. I can stalk a deer and shoot it, navigate with a compass, swim two miles, and raise a sourdough starter from scratch. So I am mostly apocalypse-ready.
