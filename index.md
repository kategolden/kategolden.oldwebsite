I'm an investigative reporter and the multimedia director at the [Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism](http://wisconsinwatch.org). I've worked there since 2010 and have helped the Center transform into the scrappy, award-winning organization it is today.

I am moving to Sydney, Australia, in around August 2015.

A smattering of my work interests:

* Data-driven journalism, including visualizations and especially maps
* The environment (mostly water issues)
 - Climate change
 - Endocrine disruption
 - Nutrient pollution
 - Groundwater supply
 - Science and public policy
* Radio and podcasting
* Design
* Creative storytelling
* Public records access and government transparency

My personal interests include hunting for mushrooms or animals, fishing and foraging (ancient history: <a href="http://madisonforager.wordpress.com">Madison Forager</a>). I love the Western United States, particularly Alaska. I can stalk a deer and shoot it, navigate with a compass, swim two miles, and raise a sourdough starter from scratch. So I am mostly apocalypse-ready.
