{"name":"Kate Golden","tagline":"Investigative multimedia journalist","body":"I'm an investigative reporter and the multimedia director at the [Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism](wisconsinwatch.org). I've worked there since 2010 and have helped the Center transform into the scrappy, award-winning organization it is today.\r\n\r\nNow I'm looking for work in Sydney, Australia, where I plan to move later this year. [Contact me](kate.golden@gmail.com) if you have leads on that.\r\n\r\nMy work interests include:\r\n\r\n* Data-driven journalism\r\n* The environment (mostly water issues)\r\n - Climate change\r\n - Endocrine disruption\r\n - Nutrient pollution\r\n - Groundwater supply\r\n - Science and public policy\r\n* Radio and podcasting\r\n* Design\r\n* Creative storytelling\r\n* Public records laws\r\n\r\nStories: <http://wisconsinwatch.org/author/kgolden>\r\nTwitter: [@wiswatchkate](twitter.com/wiswatchkate)\r\n\r\nMy personal interests include mushroom hunting, fishing, hunting and foraging (ancient history: [Madison Forager](http://madisonforager.wordpress.com)). I love the Western United States, particularly Alaska. I can stalk a deer and shoot it, navigate with a compass, swim two miles, and raise a sourdough starter from scratch. When I learn to throw and catch I will be apocalypse-ready.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
